Frontend things I need to do:
1/8/2025
Think of how I want to display items.
Ill have to think about the fact that ill have to make and recieve the calls to the database so first I 
should make dummy items
1/10/2025
Created the dummy items now all thats left is to make sure that the dummy items show their description
and whether are done or not. Thinking maybe ill show the descriptions after clicking on the item.
At least for mobile. maybe for on computer I show it to the side of the name of the task item to do
so that way I can use that extra space. In fact I could probably do something similar with the list display as I can show how many items out of total items are complete. Same thing can be done for mobile next to item name to show if its complete or not instead of showing it once clicking on the item.

I should probably add some more comments to my backend and frontend
